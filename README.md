### Task:
1. Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn.
2. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify if a customer is going to churn or not, making it easier for the company to target these 'high-risk' churn customers as a part of its retention efforts.

### Task:
1. Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer purchases.
2. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify if a customer is going to purchase, in this case, whether customers will purchase car insurance or not, thus making it easier for this company to target its customers most likely to purchase as a part of its marketing promotional efforts.

### Task:
1. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify website visitorsâ€™ purchase intention, how likely is it that they will make a purchase, thus making it easier for the company to target and convert these customers as a part of its marketing promotional efforts.
