### Task:
1. Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn.
2. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify if a customer is going to churn or not, making it easier for the company to target 'high-risk' customers (ie. those that might churn) as apart of it retention strategy/efforts.

### Task:
1. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify whether user (i.e. customer) intended to make a purchase on online webstore. The dataset is from an online webstore and is related to user activites on the webstore.
