## Project: Predicting Customer Churn (Bank)
https://github.com/rgoubault/machine_learning/blob/main/bank_customer_churn.ipynb

Task:
1. Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn for the bank.
2. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify if a customer is going to churn or not, making it easier for the company (bank) to target 'high-risk' customers (ie. those that might churn) as apart of it retention strategy/efforts.



## Project: Predicting Customer Churn (Telecommunications)

Task:
1. Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer churn for the telecommunications company.
2. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify if a customer is going to churn or not, making it easier for the company (telecommunications) to target 'high-risk' customers (ie. those that might churn) as apart of it retention strategy/efforts.



## Project: Predicting Customer Purchase (Car Insurance)
https://github.com/rgoubault/machine_learning/blob/main/car_insurance.ipynb

Task:
1. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify whether customers will buy car insurance or not. The dataset is from a bank and is related to direct marketing campaigns.



## Project: Predicting Oniline Shoppers Purchase Intent (Retail)
https://github.com/rgoubault/machine_learning/blob/main/online_shoppers.ipynb

Task:
1. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify whether user (i.e. customer) intended to make a purchase on online webstore. The dataset is from an online webstore and is related to user activites on the webstore.


## Project: Predicting Breast Cancer
https://github.com/rgoubault/machine_learning/blob/main/breast_cancer_v1.ipynb

Task:
1. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify whether or not breast tissue is malignant (cancerous) or benign (harmless). The dataset contains measurements of breast tissue, obtained by a medical imaging technique. From that, several measurements of the cell nuclei are derived.
