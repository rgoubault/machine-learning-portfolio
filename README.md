## Project: Predicting Breast Cancer

In this case study, we aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify whether or not breast tissue is malignant (cancerous) or benign (harmless). The dataset contains measurements of breast tissue, obtained by a medical imaging technique. From that, several measurements of the cell nuclei are derived.

Type: Binary Classification

Model: Logistic Regression (Linear)
