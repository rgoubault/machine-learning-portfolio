### Task:
1. Identify and visualize which factors contribute to customer purchases.
2. We aim to accomplish building a prediction model that will classify if a customer is going to purchase, in this case, whether customers will purchase car insurance or not, thus making it easier for this company to target its customers most likely to purchase as a part of its marketing promotional efforts.
